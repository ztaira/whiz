## whiz (module)
### whiz
NAME
    whiz -- display and/or navigate to bookmarks set in a text file

SYNOPSIS
    whiz [bookmark_name]

DESCRIPTION
    Search the bookmark file for a given bookmark name and navigate to the
    directory file associated with that bookmark. 

    If, instead of navigating to a certain directory, you want to open a window
    at said directory, use the `whizo` function. It is exactly the same as whiz,
    but opens a new window via the `open` command rather than navigate to a
    directory using the `cd` command.

    If no bookmark name is given, display the list of bookmarks. The bookmarks
    will be displayed as follows:

    Here are the bookmarks you can currently whiz to:
    [name]..............[directory]
    [name]..............[directory]

endwhiz
.
### whizadd
NAME
    whizadd -- add the current directory to the whiz bookmarks file

SYNOPSIS
    whizadd bookmark_name

DESCRIPTION
    Upon passing in a bookmark name, this function will create the bookmark
    bookmark_name that is associated with the current directory. This bookmark
    will be stored in the whiz bookmarks file, and will be stored in the
    following format:

    [bookmark_name] [directory]

endwhizadd
